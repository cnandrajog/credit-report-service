## Current state and improvements in the application

- The system will be reading the input from a file, `input.txt`, which is in the root of the project.
- Inspiration for overall design has been **template pattern**.
- For simplicity , i am reading the whole file at once. 
  If the file/input is large, then we should read a few lines at a time and process it in a loop.
